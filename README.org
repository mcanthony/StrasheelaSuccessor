* Strasheela Successor

This software is intended to be a better version of [[http://strasheela.sourceforge.net/strasheela/doc/index.html][Strasheela]] at some stage. It is intended to run much faster allowing for realtime use (and is therefore implemented in C++ using [[http://www.gecode.org/][Gecode]]). It is also planned that it can be interfaced from other programming systems (e.g., via OpenSoundControll or/and [[http://swig.org/][SWIG]]. Current plans on the design can be read [[./Strasheela-Successor.org][here]].

Anyway, at the moment this is just a very early version not ready to be used yet.
